I think the use of a feature like Parkbot may be a fun toy for scientist/nerds in the lab, but it's unlikely to provide useful information to someone desperate to find actionable suggestions.

I think there is already an inefficient number of organizations providing REDUNDANT information and preventing the designation of one organization as the de facto REPRESENTATIVE of all people living with PD in dealing with other stakeholders in the community. A few examples: (1) development of a template for inpatient hospital admissions of PD patients--if hospitals are getting an earful from the Parkinson's Foundation, the APDA, FOX, Phinney, Grant, Gibson, etc etc etc, they're going to avoid addressing this critical issue until one NGO emerges as the one who gets [stuff] done. (2) The redundancy is wasteful--exec teams, fundraising competition all make it hard to support any of them. (3) The Parkinson Foundation is doing some good work in the exercise area but is falling short of the unified national solution to creating efficient infrastructure. It's hard to push them to take the next steps which would provide REAL VALUE when a dozen other competitors will dilute their efforts. 

SOOOO, there are additional resources you could provide that would make your effort more complete--but I think you should provide less rather than more. You should team up with the Parkinson's Foundation (and urge them to take over the APDA and maybe others) to provide a single point of contact that patients and other stakeholders can rely upon to efficiently deal with PD issues.
