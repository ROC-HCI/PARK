Can you prevent the pop-up notice appearing, saying the camera is off?  For some tasks, the notice appeared immediately before beginning them, and while it appeared that at some point the camera turned back on, that was distracting.  2. Once the button to turn off recording is selected, can the program move quicker to the next screen? - It appears as if the button hadn't been pressed and that the recording is still happening.  3. For tasks that are supposed to last a certain number of seconds, can you stop the timer when that time has been reached instead of letting the timer continue counting?  4. During the countdown prior to a task beginning, in the recording screen, can you show us rather than a black screen? - Otherwise, you do not know that you or your hand is in the screen and centered until after the recording begins.

I did find my way back to the survey but made do without the video instructions. Best solution would be to make sure the links all work, and then Parkie-proof it by offering a brief instruction at the beginning about what to do if there is a problem. Whatever was there now, if intentional, didn't work. I think you might also let the user know at the beginning of the tasks section how many tasks will follow and that each video will be followed by a text cue at the top of the task frame as reminder of the instructions.
