Getting the diagnosis and summary of factors that led to the diagnosis doesn't help the patient feel empowered or in control of health; the patient needs to know the next steps (i.e. See a neurologist.  Exercise.  Eat a Mediterranean diet.  Perhaps join a support group or check out an organization like Davis Phinney.)",

I think the statement could be softened up and have language added, suggesting that people should follow up with a Neurologist or MDS for a diagnosis.  I liked seeing the individual severity associated with each category of speech, facial expressions, and motor tasks, but would like more detail (i.e. ""When doing finger taps, the right hand moved slowly"" OR ""When you spoke, your voice was very soft."")","Regarding the questions above, I didn't really understand the wording of the beginning of the first few questions - ""The description of the risk of demonstrating features of Parkinson's Disease..."".  Maybe it's just the wording, but there hadn't been a description of the risk, so I was confused and just answered the questions as best as I could."

It's not clear how much the user taking the test will have been briefed about PD before the test is given and how quickly the user will be advised of next steps. If PD is ""likely"" the user should be immediately informed that there are proactive steps that can be taken to slow progression/reduce symptoms over several years. I'm sure there's a more concise way to say that but you get the idea: provide hope and reassurance and specific next steps.

Also, there doesn't seem to be any purpose for giving the tiered results by task. Think about what you want the user to take away from this page. Why would he/she care about relative performance in each task area? I don't think you should tell anyone that a symptom is ""severe"" without a coach present to explain why this is important to the user, e.g., how it effects prognosis or treatment, including strong recommendations for an exercise program, diet and sleep.",
